      When enabled the firmware will initialize the TCA9554 IO-expander (via the
      existing I2C master) so the board power control pin can be toggled even if
      other I2C equipment (RTC/IMU) is disabled via CONFIG_I2C_EQUIPMENT_ENABLED.

    default n
    help
      Enable board I2C equipment including accelerometer, gyroscope and RTC.
      When disabled, the i2c_equipment component will provide safe no-op stubs so
      other code can build without the hardware present.
